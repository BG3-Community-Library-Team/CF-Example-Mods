## Includes

### Example SpellLists - Warlock OneDnd UA7 Spells

This mod uses the Compatability Framework to add __Speak with Animals__ and __Bane__ to the Warlock Spell Lists and if 5E Spells is loaded, __Detect Magic__ will also be added to the spells list.

At the time of writing, the Global Dictionary has not been set up for JSON insertion, so it may not be clear which lists are being added to upon browsing the code. The table below indicates all of the spell selection lists that the indicated spells will be added to when this mod is loaded.

The Compatibility Framework makes it easy to set your mods up for compatibility with other mods, just by utilizing the Framework's API. To find out how, [check out the CF Wiki page](https://github.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Subclass-Compatibility-Framework/wiki/Adding-a-Subclass-to-the-Compatibility-Framework).

For more information on the Compatibility Framework API and JSON-based Config loading methods, take a look at the following pages:

## Installation
This mod works with [Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), and possibly Vortex and Manual
Installations. BG3 Mod Managers is by far the simplest method, and as such is recommended one.
